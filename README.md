## **Analysis Overview**

After a memorable trip to New York City, we saw that one of the wonderful parts of the trip was using the CitiBikes in the city to explore and getting to know the city and its residents. When we arrived home, we wanted to determine if a similar program would be successful in our hometown of Des Moines, Iowa. After hearing from an angel investor that was willing to provide seed money, we had to create data visualizations that would help us tell our story and convince the investors that this program could be successful in Des Moines.


## **Results**

### **Top Starting Locations**

This first visualization is showing where the top starting locations are that the riders picked up their bikes to start their trip. This cross section of the map shows Manhattan which is densely populated with residents but also has a large tourism industry as well. We can see that there are a lot of rides across the area shown but there are some specific locations that tend to be more heavily used to start which we might believe to me due to tourists. This can help us determine that at the tourist locations in Des Moines, we should consider having more bikes located at those locations than in less populated/desirable tourist locations.


### **August Peak Hours** 
![August Peak Hours](/Images/August%20Peak%20Hours.png)

In this peak hours chart, we can see that from about 7am to 8pm the bikes are being heavily utilized with some higher peaks around rush hour in the morning and evening. This gives us great insight to when the bikes could have scheduled maintenance done without harming the utilization when most of the riders are using the bikes. We used August as the basis for our analysis because of its ideal weather and tourism is much higher in the summer months. 


### **Gender Breakdown** 
![Gender Breakdown](/Images/Gender%20Breakdown.png)

We can see that in this chart of breakdown by gender, that males are predominantly the ones riding the bikes. It should be noted that this is across one time riders and subscribers. This could potentially help us when determining the weight limits of the bikes we purchase knowing that men generally weigh more than women and they will likely be the heaviest users of the bikes. This may also help us in determining which locations that more bikes should be stationed at.


### **User Trips by Gender** 
![User Trips by Gender](/Images/User%20Trips%20by%20Gender.png)

We can see that amount one time users that the gender breakdown is about equal across days of the week and genders. When we look at subscribers we can see that there is a higher usage among males across all days of the week. This helps us to see that with one time users many of which would likely be tourists are not specific to gender. When we look at those subscribing to the bike service, males by far are the biggest users of the service. This will help when marketing the service to male focused outlets. Again, this also helps with which types of bikes should be purchased. 

### **Trips by Gender** 
![Trips by Gender](/Images/Trips%20by%20Gender.png)

In the Trips by Gender, we can see that the usage of the bikes for females and males are during what we would consider rush hour/commute times in the morning and evening. This knowledge could help us with not only marketing but also helpful information when encouraging tourists to use the bikes that certain hours are much easier for them to find bikes etc. 

### **Checkout Times by Users** 
![Checkout Times by User](/Images/Checkout%20Times%20by%20Users.png)

The checkout times graph is showing us that most riders are using the bikes less than 20 minutes and after about 40 minutes there is very little rides that last longer than that timeframe. 

### **Checkout Times by Gender** 
![Checkout Times by Gender](/Images/Checkout%20Times%20by%20Gender.png)

We can see that regardless of gender, the time spent on the bikes is typically less than 45  minutes overall. 

### **Trips by Weekday per Hour** 
![Trips by Weekday per Hour](/Images/Trips%20by%20Weekday%20per%20Hour.png)

We then can confirm that across all trips both one time users and subscribers, the bikes are mostly utilized during commuting hours in the morning and evenings. This allows us to determine purpose of use by the riders as well as where we should concentrate the bikes when it comes to where the majority of people in Des Moines are working and commuting from. 

## **Summary**

We can see from our analysis that there is a large market for the citibikes in Des Moines especially when focused on city residents who would commute to work about 20-45 minutes. The summer months would be heavily utilized and the bikes we would purchase would need to support mostly males that would be riding them. We would want to consider their weight and heights when picking the ideal bikes. When it comes to locations, the top locations would likely be where tourists are staying or landmarks they are visiting but also for subscribers, we would want to look at locations where residents are primarily working in the city and where they all live in that 20-45 minute radius. Two more visualizations that I think would be beneficial for this analysis would first being looking at the amount of rides by each zip code in the city. Then the next step would be to do a visualization of what zip codes have the highest one time use vs which zip codes had the most subscriber rides completed which will help us even more on how many bikes and where to station them in the city.
